## 21cc.py

Simple 21 (blackjack) card counting script and trainer written in python.

This TinyTool makes use of the High-Low card counting system (see [here](http://wizardofodds.com/games/blackjack/card-counting/high-low/) for more info on card counting) and was written during one of our weekend coding challenges* (mainly out of curiosity).

It is worth noting that almost all casinos (online or otherwise) have methods of detecting/mitigating against this type of card counting and you will get b&.

#####Run the script like so:

**python 21cc.py**

and follow the instructions. It's pretty sraight forward.

#####Friday 19th Feb 2016 (PM):

- Investigated card-counting types and stuck on the High-Low system (for simplicty)
- Implemented the basic card counting system before bedtime!

#####Saturday 20th Feb 2016 (PM):
- Added deck shuffling
- Added a basic card counting trainer
- Implemented basic Multi-deck support
- Added a reset function

#####Sunday 21st Feb 2016 (PM):
- Added logical checks to auto increment the number of decks based on drawn cards
- Added deck count override
- Improved trainer by adding multiple modes of difficulty
- Added some **AWESOME** ascii art (We cheated and used [this](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Big&t=Mike%20Is%20Awesome!) awesome online ASCII art tool from Patrick Gillespie ([Github Profile](https://github.com/patorjk)) of patorjk.com

#####Future enhancements:
- Suit tracking (we started that but decided "meh")
- More ASCII art
- Remove some of the annoying things like having to type the mode!


*If you don't know about our coding challenges, it's basically an excuse for us to drink beer and build something cool over the course of a weekend. These are usually security related tools, however sometimes we like to mix it up. The only rule is we stop sunday night which is why some of the stuff we post looks like it has been shot into vi with a gattling gun.


We periodically revisit these things to tidy them up, especially if we need to use them as part of something larger; so it should get prettier and more OOP as time goes by.. Maybe.


As per usual. We accept no responsibility for any of the effects of using our any of our stuff, and we would like it if you credited us where possible.

Other than that.. Have fun!
